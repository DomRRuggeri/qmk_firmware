# Dom's KBD67 Rev2 Layout

This layout was created for a KBD67 Rev2 (KBD65 v2) in a TOFU65 case.
This means there is no blocker, for a total of 68 Keys.

There's a lot of focus on one-handed actions in this layout, as I often find myself with a mouse in one hand, and typing quick commands with the other.
