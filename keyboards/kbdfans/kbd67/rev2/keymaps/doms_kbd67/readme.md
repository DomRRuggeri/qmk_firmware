# Dom's KBD67 Rev2 Layout

This layout was created for the KBD67 Rev2 (KBD65 v2 PCB) in a TOFU65 case.
This means there is no blocker, for a total of 68 Keys.

## Notes

There's emphasis on one-handed actions in this layout, as I often find myself with a mouse in one hand, typing quick commands with the other.
There's a MO(1) at the bottom right of the layout, as well as when holding Capslock on the left. Some actions are repeated on the funtion layer on either the left or right side, so they can be executed with one hand.

Since the RGB backlight bleeds through the plate a little bit, I've used some colors to identify modes. Default layer, function layer, media layer, Capslock active, and Reset/Flashing colors can all be set individually.
